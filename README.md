# HotspotHunter

This project is an android substitute for [rpi-vehicletracking](https://github.com/MrKrisKrisu/rpi-vehicletracking).

Its purpose is, to gather information about the wifi networks near you and submit that to an instance of [Vehicletracking Core](https://github.com/MrKrisKrisu/vehicletracking-core)

(This project was mainly used to take my first few baby steps with kotlin and android)
